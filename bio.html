                        My name is Patrick, and I'm a junior at Northwestern  majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Data Science
                        and Engineering. Growing up with Silicon Valley right in my backyard, my passion for engineering and technology
                        began at a young age. I've always loved creating things for others&mdash;from building a chessboard in high school
                        woodshop for my chess-loving family to selling personally-made math packets on a busy street corner as a kid,
                        I've always been passionate about leveraging my skills to create something useful for others.<br><br>
                        After discovering my love for programming in college, I decided to continue creating for others by pursuing a
                        career as a full-stack software engineer. I'm passionate about using my technical skills to develop usable,
                        scalable software that directly addresses a problem, and I hope to continue to do so professionally.
                        I'm particularly interested in front-end development, user interface design, and human-computer interaction.<br><br>
                        Outside of software development, my hobbies include following my favorite San Francisco sports
                        teams (Go Giants!),
                        mountain biking, and watching comic book movies.<br><br>
